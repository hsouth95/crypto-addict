# Crypto Addict

A basic web page that tracks when you view it to give you the change in crypto currency prices since you last visited.

Currently uses [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to keep track of prices at the last visit meaning that data is not stored outside of your own browser. [CodeGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) is the API used to get back the price data. As the free tier is used, data might not be as accurate or up-to-date.
